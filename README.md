# 100DaysOfCodeFinTechApp


This project is about creating a Finance Application that simply stores Accounts Informations, Tranctions History etc. Which has Backend `api folder` and Frontend `view folder`.

For the Frontend, we will be implementing designs for the Landing Page using any of this [Landing Page UI](https://dribbble.com/mannie411/collections/3929577-landing-page) and this [Dashboard Ui](https://dribbble.com/mannie411/collections/3929518-finance)
